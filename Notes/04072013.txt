UniFormal brainstorming meeting
04/07/2013, Ulm
People present: Alberto Pardo, Josï¿½ Nuno, Lambert, Pedro, Roland

We brainstormed about what UniFormal should be, what it should not be, what its
goals are, and how these can best be achieved. We agreed that the language
should include basic features such as definitions and statements, and it should
not enforce a particular typing disciple, or semantics, for example.

We will proceed by defining a possible abstract syntax for UniFormal, together
with some examples. This will be done independently by each member, and we will
then compare the approaches and try to fuse them. We will also look at related
systems already existing (such as OMDoc, MathML, OpenMath, etc.) and try to
understand how UniFormal should differ from them.

Each of us should have something to share with the rest by the end of this 
month (July), or preferably even within two weeks.
